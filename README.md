**Weather Map Application**
An Angular application that integrates with the OpenWeatherAPI to fetch and display weather conditions for any city around the world. Users can enter a city name to see real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

**Features**
- Enter any city name to get real-time weather information.
- Displays temperature (in °C), humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Clean and responsive UI built with Angular and Bootstrap.

**Future Scope**

- Multiple Weather APIs: Integrate additional weather APIs for more accurate and detailed data, including hourly and weekly forecasts.

- Geolocation-Based Weather: Automatically fetch weather data based on the user's current location using GPS.

- Weather Alerts: Implement real-time alerts for extreme weather conditions like storms or high temperatures.

- AI-Powered Forecasting: Use machine learning to predict weather trends and patterns based on historical data.
